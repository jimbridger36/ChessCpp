# ChessCpp

I first wrote this in a Cython/Python stack then decided that I wasn't happy with the compromises Cython was forcing upon me and since it was a project for fun and I didn't have anyone depending on me to finish I decided to rewrite it in C++ with a Cython wrapper for Python, I didn't use pure C++ for ease of debugging and use of the front end.
